            There’s a lot of HR software solutions out there, but there’s only
            one that’s designed by a practitioner and an attorney specifically
            for dental and medical practices. That’s us. Every feature,
            function, and product is designed for healthcare teams. No other HR
            solution can say that.

          <h2 class="item__title">Customized & Compliant Handbooks</h2>
          <p class="item__text">
            You don’t need to keep up with employment law, but your policies
            definitely do. We automatically update your policies and handbooks
            to account for changes to laws and regulations at the local, state,
            and even federal levels.

          <h2 class="item__title">Compliance-First. Always.</h2>
          <p class="item__text">
            Just because you haven’t faced a lawsuit doesn’t mean it’s not
            coming. Other software leaves compliance up to you. We take care of
            it with a total solution that ensures you stay legal.

          <h2 class="item__title">Practice Protection = Profit Protection</h2>
          <p class="item__text">
            Every year thousands of practices are attacked with expensive
            lawsuits that not only cost a lot but cause irreparable reputational
            damage. Simply keeping compliant allows you to mitigate nearly 99%*
            of HR-related legal claims. *1% of legal claims require beating
            someone with a stick.
